# on other processors

# perf counter data being collected only in the region of code surrounded by marker start/stop

# iterate over some number of threads. You will need to modify this for HW4 to reflect
# the levels of concurrency in the assignment

# Note: in HW4, we are NOT using OMP_NUM_THREADS to tell your program and OpenMP the
# concurrency level. instead, we tell likwid-perfctr the concurrency level,
# and then likwid-perfctr manages setting OMP_NUM_THREADS

# For the BMMCO code, you MUST make two modifications to the job-blocked-omp script that
# cmake generates from job.in:
# 1. uncomment the for loop that iterates over block sizes: for B in 4 16 63, and uncomment
#    the following line containing "do", and then also uncomment the line containing the
#    closing "done # iterating over block size".
# 2. modify the srun line where you run your program to add a -B $B to the end of the argument list,
# for example:
#   srun -n 1 likwid-perfctr $MARKER_FLAG -g $PERF_COUNTER_GROUP -C N:0-$maxcore ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N
# becomes
#   srun -n 1 likwid-perfctr $MARKER_FLAG -g $PERF_COUNTER_GROUP -C N:0-$maxcore ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N -B $B
#

for N in 128 512 2048 # loop over problem sizes
   do

#   for B in 4 16  # uncomment these two lines
#      do            # to also iterate over block sizes for the blocked version

      for t in 1 4 16 64  # loop over concurrency level
#      for t in 1  # if running the blas version, uncomment this line and comment out the previous line looping over t in 1 4 16 64
         do
         let maxcore=$t-1

# if doing the blocked version, be sure to add -B $B to the following two lines
         echo srun -n 1 likwid-perfctr $MARKER_FLAG -g $PERF_COUNTER_GROUP -C N:0-$maxcore ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N 
         srun -n 1 likwid-perfctr $MARKER_FLAG -g $PERF_COUNTER_GROUP -C N:0-$maxcore ./benchmark-@BENCHMARK@ -N $N 

         done # iterate over concurrency level
#   done # iterate over block size, uncomment me if doing a loop over blocks

done # iterate over problem size
